Database and UI for a hotel service

Exercises for Databases course, 6th Semester 2021 of the Electrical and Computer Engineering School at the National Technical University of Athens.

In this project my partner and I created a database for a hotel service, ran some queries on it, and developed a simple UI to interact with it.
